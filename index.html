EXAM: MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Back pain.
Decreased signal intensity on T2 weighted images is present in the L1-2, L3-4 and L5-S1
intervertebral discs. The
L1-2 and L3-4 intervertebral discs are decreased in height. These findings are consistent with
disc degenera;on,
There is no disc bulge or hernia;on at the L1-2, L2-3 and L4-5 levels. There is hypertrophy of the
posterior
ar;cula;ng facets at the L4-5 level. The nerves exit the neural foramina without compression.
A diffuse disc bulge and small central disc protrusion are present at the L3-4 level. There is
minimal compression
of the thecal sac. The L3 nerves exit the neural foramina without compression.
A diffuse disc bulge is present at the L5-S1 level. This abuts the thecal sac and S1 nerves. There
is hypertrophy
of the posterior ar;cula;ng facets. The L5 nerves exit the neural foramina without compression.
The conus medullaris is normal in appearance termina;ng at the level of the L1-2 intervertebral
disc. A
hemangioma is present in the L2 vertebral body. Normal signal intensity is present in the
remaining lumbar
vertebral bodies.
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse disc bulge and small central disc protrusion at the L3-4 level with minimal thecal sac
